    <h1>Async await in javascript</h1>
    <p>Async is a keyword , which is used to declare a fuction asyncronus, is always returned a Promise object</p>
    <p>and await is alwys used with async keyword, both keyword are use to handle promises in ES6</p>
    <p>Before async await , we handled the promises with "then " keyword </p>
    <P>When a JS engine find a await keyword , it suspended the executeion of the function and do other task of a
        program , and as this promises gets resloved, JS engine again load this function to callstack and start the
        execution of that fuction where its was left the exection.</P>
